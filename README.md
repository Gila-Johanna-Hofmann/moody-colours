# Moody Colours
[Moody Colours](https://gila-johanna-hofmann.github.io/moody-colours/) is a simple webpage that lets users create RGB-colours based on their general mood.<br/>
It's a fun learning project and my first time writing Javascript completely on my own.<br/>
I came up with the idea when learning about colours in programming.

# Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS

# Usage
Toggle the three ranges on the [page](https://gila-johanna-hofmann.github.io/moody-colours/) in a way that fits your mood at that moment. From the ranges, an RGB colour will be calculated: the ranges represent red, green and blue. Two of the ranges are inverted to produce a more colourful and less grey-ish result. The RGB values are then immediately used as the pages background colour and converted to a HEX colour-code that is ouputted at the bottom of the page. The HEX-code can be copied to the users clipboard via a button.

Project is *finished*
