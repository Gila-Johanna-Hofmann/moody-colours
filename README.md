# notes on how the color is created
The three ranges represent the three things that will most likely affect your mood: your feelings, how your body is doing and how you feel about your environment.
The ranges pick up a number from 0 to 255 to calculate an RGB color. Two of the three ranges are inverted, to produce a more vibrant RGB color-range.
The RGB color-range is then converted to a HEX-value that can be copied to the clipboard.
