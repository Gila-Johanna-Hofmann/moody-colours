# notes on how the color is created
The slides represents the three circumstances that will most likely affect your mood: feelings, how the body is doing and the environment.
The sliders pick up a number from 0 to 255 to calculate an RGB color.
One of the sliders has an inverted range, to make really saturated, dark colors less likely as an outcome.
